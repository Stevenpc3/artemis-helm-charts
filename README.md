This is an example of Artemis docker image and helm charts to deploy that image to kubernetes.

This is not a complete working example.  It has been stripped down to only the necessary parts to demonstrate structure and implementation.

There is an example folder of "umbrealla" charts that use the artemis chart as a dependency.
